//Features of REACT JS 
//1.declarative -- predefined code are there in js , import that code and use , donot think about the implementation


// npm , npx , yarn 


//inbuilt scripts /folders/dependencies everything is present in node modules , this is heart of react file 
// react is heavy because of it only  

//for making vite (faster then npm npx and script is downloaded parallely)
// commands
// npm create vite@latest 
// cd vite-project
// npm install
// npm run dev


//in npm npx the entry point is index.js and in vite it is main.jsx (javascript and xml)

// without reloading the data is loaded 

//module bundler --to bundler all the modules together (like home , login etc ) and return new module for browser
//types of module bundler 
//webpack is module bundler
// vite is also module bundler but it is faster than webpack
//parcel
//rollup -- used in vite 
//Browsify

//hot module replacement  dependencies -- which helps in dynamically updation of the new elements or data in the webpage
//-- exchanges , adds, or removes modules while an application is running without a full reload
