/*
Array-- a collection of different elements 
it is a continous block of memory 
in js array is heterogeneous in nature 

-- in js we can create arrays in two ways 
1. by using array literals
syntax for this 
 let arr=[10,"shree",true]

2. by using array constructor  (using new keyword)
syntax for this  (work of new keyword is to create object)
let arr=new Array(10,"shree",true)

when we pass only one value in constructor that will create array of size of the value we have passed when it is num ( will have null values)
otherwise will consider it as a element

homogeneous - same type of data 
heterogeneous - different type of data


let arr=[10,"shree",true,function name(params){},{},[]]


-- array length is not fixed in js , after declaration we can add elements
