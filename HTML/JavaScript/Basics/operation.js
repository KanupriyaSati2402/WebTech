// Comparison -- == != > < >= <= ==(only values will be checked) ===(values as well as datatype)

//Nullish Operator
// -- if the lhs is having any null then only then the rhs value will be assigned to it 
//let a=null;
//console.log(a || 10)

// based on operand 
// 3 types
// Unary the operator which will take one operand at a time
// binary the operator which will take two operand at a time
// ternary the operator which will take three operand at a time
