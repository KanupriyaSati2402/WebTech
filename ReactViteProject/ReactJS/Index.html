    How react works internally 

    -- it is for spa , when we pass our html file to the browser than a dom is created (real dom)
    -- at the same time virtual is also created 
    -- in react we have virtual dom (replica of real dom )
    -- react application interact with the virtual dom not on the real dom 
    -- whenever there is any change changes happen in virtual dom and after change it will create a new virtual dom 
    -- the changes will be present on the new virtual dom 
    -- diffing algo -- it will compare new virtual dom to old virtual dom and find the changes 
    -- patching algo -- will updated in the real dom 
    -- and this entire process is known as reconcilation process 
    -- once this process is done real dom will be changed and again virtual dom will be changed as it should be the 
    -- replica of real dom
    -- so this is how react works internally

    -- process is synchronous 
    -- and for more updation will take more time 
    -- for this we have react fiber  -- this is aysnch 

    -- react fiber - it is an internal js engine used to make react faster and smarter 
    -- it is used to make react more efficient and faster
    -- in older version of react we didn't have it thats why they were slow now it is there 
    -- the current version of react fiber is 16.8 

    --in react fiber the process of reconcilation will happen but in asynch way 

    -- the dom methods will not work in react as react only intreact with virtual dom
