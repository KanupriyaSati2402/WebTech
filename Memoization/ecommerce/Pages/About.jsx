        <p>
          Zoho Commerce is a cloud-based e-commerce platform that enables
          businesses to set up and manage online stores for selling products like
          clothing, electronics, medical supplies, and household items. Each product can
          be listed with detailed specifications, such as price, dimensions, and
          other key information. While Zoho Commerce currently supports only
          physical products, plans to introduce digital product sales are in
          development.
